📚 Library Management System (C)

A console-based Library Management System developed in C as part of the Structured Programming Lab (SE 121) course at Daffodil International University.
We had four members in this project. This project demonstrates the use of structures, arrays, loops, functions, conditional statements, and string handling in C, fulfilling the Structured Programming Lab (SE 121) requirements. 

This system helps manage books, students, and borrowing records in a structured and efficient way.

🚀 Features

1. Add New Books


      Easily insert book details such as title, author, number of pages, and price.


      Automatically stores books in memory (array-based system).


2. Display All Books


      View a complete list of all available books in the library.


      Displays book name, author, total pages, and price neatly formatted.


3. Search Books by Author


      Find all books written by a specific author.


      Useful for quickly locating all works by a particular writer.


4. Search Book by Title


      Look up a single book by its name.


      Instantly retrieves book details like author, pages, and price.


5. User-Friendly Menu System


      Simple text-based interface for smooth navigation.


      Easy to use for both beginners and testers.


6. Dynamic Book Storage (In-Memory)


      Supports up to 100 books (can be increased via MAX_BOOKS constant).


      No external file storage — ideal for quick testing and lab demonstrations.


7. Input Validation (Basic)


      Prevents invalid menu selections with an “Invalid choice” warning.


8. Structured Programming Approach


      Implements modular design using functions and structures (struct library).

      Enhances readability, reusability, and maintainability of code.
